The best chat app. That is actually open.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
  pnpm install
```

2. Create a `apps/web/.env` file based on [`apps/web/.env.example`](./app/web/.env.example).

3. Run the development server:

```bash
  pnpm dev
```

The development server should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
